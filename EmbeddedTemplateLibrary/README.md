# Embedded Template Library

I am putting my examples for the Embedded Template Library Arduino library into a folder here.

These examples are derived from the Embedded Template Library documentation.

https://www.etlcpp.com/arduino.html

These all use Serial.print and println to provide output.

## Example_1_Vector_simple_use

This is the only Arduino example provided for the library. I have added more output.

## Example_2_StateMachine

This is one of the examples moved across to be an Arduino example.

## Example_3_Blinklist

Another adapted example

## Example_4_StateMachine

This is adapted from the Motor control example in the StateMachine documentation.
