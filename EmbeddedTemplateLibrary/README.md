# Embedded Template Library

I am putting my examples for the Embedded Template Library Arduino library into a folder here.

https://www.etlcpp.com/home.html

These examples are derived from the Embedded Template Library documentation.

https://www.etlcpp.com/arduino.html

These all use Serial.print and println to provide output.

## Example_1_Vector_simple_use

This is the only Arduino example provided for the library. I have added more output.

## Example_2_StateMachine

This is one of the examples moved across to be an Arduino example.

## Example_3_Blinklist

Another adapted example

## Example_4_StateMachine

This is adapted from the Motor control example in the StateMachine documentation.
See the web page https://www.etlcpp.com/fsm.html

## Example_5_HierarchicalStateMachine

This is an example implementation of the HierarchicalStateMachine.

## Example_6_HierarchicalStateMachine_test

This example is adapted from test code documented in the example code.
The web page https://www.etlcpp.com/hfsm.html gives an introduction without an example.
The documentation is incomplete and the problem is explained in the example code.
The example also contains some other ETL features e.g. documenting enums.
