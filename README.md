# StateMachine
 Arduino State Machine experiments

I have made this repository which was not at first visible in my GitHub as it is private and I needed to log in.

Some of these codes use the StateMachine library and some have been changed to use TaskManagerIO instead.

## arduino_state_blink_moustache

This is a new example which replaces the previous output using the Arduino moustache for output.

This shows how a format can be defined for the output of the description of a state which will then output one of an array of state descriptions.

This has now been extended to allow for run time values and also error reporting.

The extensions have now been moved to the moustache library.
